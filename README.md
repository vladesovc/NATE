## Installation
<a name="installation"></a>
  It is an application online so no instructions to start other than by opening the application. If you wanted to clone down to your local machine you can do that. Once cloned onto your machine, open the terminal and enter "npm i" and that will install all packages and run all scripts. Once you have installed the packages, we will have to run the build - go ahead and enter "npm run build". Then proceed by entering "npm run start:dev" and this will concurrently fire up the client and server side, and will allow you to open the application on your web browswer using "http://localhost:3000".
